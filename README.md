# Rachel's Recipes

Rachel's Recipes is a cross-platform mobile application that uses Xamarin.Forms. It was inspired by all those who are new to cooking (dare I say, first-time chefs! :)), especially during these unprecedented times of quarantining, social distancing, and increased cooking. It is intended to provide a single place to both search for new recipes as well as keep track of personal ones.

_This app continues to be work-in-progress and at the moment, its primary purpose is for my personal exploration of Xamarin.Forms, to learn more about the framework as a first-time user and contributer._

## App features

1. **Recipe Search** - Users can search for recipes, by specific categories if they so choose, and add copies to their personal collection.
2. **My Recipes** - Users can create and save their own recipes using the app! Recipes can also be updated and deleted from their collection.
